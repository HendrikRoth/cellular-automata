# cellular-automata :tada:
Elementary cellular automata in vanilla.js. This particular one follows Wolfram's [Rule 110](http://atlas.wolfram.com/01/01/110/) given a random initial condition and 100 generations. 

[Live version](http://lrlna.github.io/cellular-automata/).

To launch this project: 

- `git clone`
- start your fave server in project directory: e.g. `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`
- and access on your fave localhost in your fave browser: e.g. `localhost:8000`

#### Future possible improvements include:
1. Other rules for the automata to follow.
2. Automata as an object -- `code improvement` 
3. Stats: Number of changed cells over time etc.
4. Genetically evolving automata :eyes::tada::crown:
